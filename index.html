										<p>Hello baby! You mean everything to me.......
Today after hearing your thoughts I thought it was time to go back to "yahoo".
Remember baby, we used to say "yahoo" is so great it lead to "Sakush"
Sakush se yaad aya OH I USED TO WRITE IT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY WERE TOGETHER.
I know I am not doing enough for you but now ITS TIME TO IMPROVE.
I did not know where else to start so socha chalo apne relationship ke shuruat pe chale the best thing ever made "yahoo"
It brought you to me, and me to you. During March we would chat lovey dovey during the night from 9 till 3.
You shouted true love, I was crazy in love and at that moment we had one big single heart beating like crazy, and you went mad when
I said "MY HEART BEATS ONLY FOR YOU"</p>

										<p>And yes your names i remember them MISHI, CUPCAKE, BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS, BABIE, CUTIE, KITTY, SHONI, DARLING, SWEETIE (im sorry i may have missed a few), you also used to call me sweet names though at that time you did not like being called baby.
Keep in your heart always that you are my beautiful princess and forever and ever you will be my beautiful princess.*:) happy
I remember those nights of June where we used to talk throughout the night...aah the BLISSFUL MOMENTS.
Then we met in OCTOBER for the first time and you said "Tum itne bhi lambe nahi ho" and ran away with a smile.
Seeing you after so long brought a relief to my heart.. My heart sang " pehli mohabbat hai wohhh" and I was rejoicing.
You may not know this but after that sometimes I USED TO COME OUTSIDE YOUR SCHOOL JUST TO HAVE A LOOK AT  YOU and then went away
singing madly. </p>

										<p>Then we met again and and again we looked we fell in love again and again as u said "MAGIC HAPPENED", those are the real precious moments, I will cherish them for ever and ever, writing this down makes me want you so much by my side.
Well when I started writing this letter I though I would send it to you on yahoo to sak.fab from fizzi_23 but now I have a new idea in mind LET US HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
So our love was so much, even in college we have each other so we used to share things, we used to love each other so much, we helped each other and we will continue doing that..</p>

									<p>Recently I know I may have now shown my best behavior to you, but I am really sorry for it.

I understand how upset you are right now with me. I know I may have created undue pressure for you but believe me "I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU HAPPY ALWAYS". I have been silly, I have been immature but I will keep you happy always..
MAHARAJ JI ne hume milaya hai.
I am not perfect I am just a human.. I know I have made more mistakes than acceptable but baby girl believe me I will improve for you.
I know you are under a lot of pressure and I am just adding to it, that is why you become angry sometimes, you know its totally all right.
So as things get tough lets remember our pure and true love, lets remember cause of Maharaj ji we are together and WE ARE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.
So this this my love letter to you for everyone to see, its getting very late and my parents are getting angry so baby I just hope you forgive me and let me make things right. I wish and pray for your better health and hapiness and let that "LOVE" flow again.
I know we have a very lovely romantic future waiting for us. :)
